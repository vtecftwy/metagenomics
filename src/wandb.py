# Classes and functions to support WandB process
# COMMENT: What to do in this module?
# [ ]   Define main operations involving WandB
#       - preparing dataset and loading datasets as artifact
#       - training a model with a dataset and hyperparameters
#       - testing / validating model with test dataset
#       - infering with now data
# 
# 
# [ ]   Function required in dataset preparation -> raw_data, processed_data, code, 
# 
# [ ]   Function required in model training -> dataset, code, model, hyperparameters
#       - how to track epochs, learning rates and other 
#       - how to track gradients and activations
# 
# [ ]   Function required in model testing -> dataset, code, trained model, preformance and reports
